# SDG Landing Page

## Goal
Build a stunning, interactive, and highly modern "Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)" demo landing page for Sumgait State University, featuring a premium SaaS dashboard aesthetic, glassmorphism, Recharts visualization, and Framer Motion animations.

## Tasks
- [x] Run ui-ux-pro-max to generate design system
- [ ] Initialize/Verify Next.js App Router structure and install required dependencies (`lucide-react`, `framer-motion`, `recharts`, etc.) → Verify: `npm run dev` works
- [ ] Configure `tailwind.config.ts` with brand colors (Emerald greens, soft earthy tones) and custom utility classes (glassmorphism) → Verify: Colors available in Tailwind
- [ ] Implement Hero Section with floating abstract pattern and bold typography → Verify: Hero displays full screen with smooth load animations
- [ ] Implement Interactive 17 SDGs Section (hover-to-expand accordion/grid) → Verify: Hovering expands to display university-specific actions
- [ ] Implement Environmental Impact Dashboard with animated stat cards and line/bar chart → Verify: Recharts chart renders and numbers count up
- [ ] Implement Bento Grid for University Activities seamlessly grouping 4 categories → Verify: Grid layout responds correctly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Review UI against `web-design-guidelines` → Verify: Passes accessibility, contrast, and layout audits

## Done When
- [ ] The landing page looks exactly like a premium SaaS dashboard
- [ ] All defined sections (Hero, SDGs, Dashboard, Bento Grid) are fully functional and animated
- [ ] Code is modular and uses dummy data arrays for easy database integration later
